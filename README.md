# Molecular-dynamics-simulation-of-active-polymers-under-cylindrical-confinement
The project shows how to simulate the motion of active polymers under cylindrical confinement, by using the molecular dynamics simulation method based on the LAMMPS software. 
## Preparation for simulation
This project is conducted with the open-source software LAMMPS, so we should configure the environment and compile the related files accordingly. You can download the packages from <https://www.lammps.org/download.html>. 

Next building LAMMPS with cmake. In the linux terminal window, Go to the directory where the downloaded package is located:
```
cd /path/lammps
```
